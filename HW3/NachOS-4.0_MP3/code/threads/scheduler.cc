// scheduler.cc 
//	Routines to choose the next thread to run, and to dispatch to
//	that thread.
//
// 	These routines assume that interrupts are already disabled.
//	If interrupts are disabled, we can assume mutual exclusion
//	(since we are on a uniprocessor).
//
// 	NOTE: We can't use Locks to provide mutual exclusion here, since
// 	if we needed to wait for a lock, and the lock was busy, we would 
//	end up calling FindNextToRun(), and that would put us in an 
//	infinite loop.
//
// 	Very simple implementation -- no priorities, straight FIFO.
//	Might need to be improved in later assignments.
